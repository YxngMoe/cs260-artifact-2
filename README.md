# cs260-artifact-2

Milestone 3

The artifact for your ePortfolio is a C++ application that uses a binary search tree data structure to store bid information and allows the user to rapidly search for a certain bid ID. It was first developed in February 2023 for CS 260. I chose this item for my ePortfolio because it exhibits my knowledge of C++ and ability to apply sorting algorithms to bespoke data structures. Specifically, the artifact demonstrates my ability to create and deconstruct bespoke data structures, as well as my ability to apply complicated logic. Especially with technical interviews being based on these type of algorithms it was great practice and achieved successfully

The artifact was improved by incorporating validation and binary search for quicker bid ID retrieval. This enhances the program's usefulness and performance while demonstrating your expertise in algorithm design and data structures. The upgrades also show your ability to improve old code to fit new needs.

Through enhancing and modifying the artifact, I discovered the importance of memory management in C++ and how it might affect application performance. I also acquired experience adding new features to an existing codebase, which improved my problem-solving abilities. One of the difficulties I encountered was ensuring that the new features worked easily with the current codebase while preserving the effectiveness of the binary search tree technique.
